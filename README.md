This project was created to fulfill the requirements of CSI5324 at Baylor University.

Authors: Christen Barringer, Faizan Azam, Joshua Wester, Kevin Fritz, Matthew Tuan

## How to run code

To run the code locally, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

The [backend code repo](https://github.com/household-four/BearlyPassing) must also be running. Once the both codebases are running, 
open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

During development, if things are rendering strangely after making changes, use ctrl+shift+R to hard refresh the page.

## User Guide
Once the app is running, navigating to `http://localhost:4200/` will bring you to the login page. 

We did not implement traditional authentication, instead focusing our efforts on demonstrating the relationships 
between the entities in our system. As such, you may simply choose a user from the list to 'log in' as that user.
